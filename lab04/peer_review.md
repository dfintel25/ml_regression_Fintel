### Review one other GitHub repository and provide feedback on:
Their Name: **Brittany Dowdle**
Their Repo: **https://github.com/Bdowdle4/ml-regression-dowdle/tree/main**

**Opening Thoughts:**
I chose to review Brittany's project after seeing how well executed everything was and that she utilized the same data source as I. 
1) Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?)
   1) Ans: VERY well done. Impressively organized and thoughtfully structured.
2) Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)
   1) Ans: Yes, they made good sense and she thought further towards developing additional ones that I did not. 
   
3) Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)
   1) Ans: Model results are very well captured and presented. Additionally, her models performed MUCH better than mine. I appreciatd her tabular view of the performance results. 
   
4) Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)
   1) Ans: Yes, the summary at the end is very thorough and technically insightful. It's clear she worked very diligently on the details across her project and made weighted improvements to her work along the way. Great job!
